All of them have been tested for best quality. These are only copy righted to the point that you may use them and copy them, but you have to refer to me as the maker if you are asked/or re-uploading. If you have any question, comment, or complaint, please refer to my email at: matthewkcolspac@gmail.com

Things used to make these: Terragen, Skiingpenguin's script for rendering, a copy of skiingpenguin's script to make it render up-side-down, time and effort.

Thank you for your time.
