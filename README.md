# README

@file: This is my coursework 2 description for Computer Graphics. I created a **Christmas village** 3D scene.

## File Structure

* Report 
  * Includes all the details I have implemented.
* Video
  * You could run the source code to hear the music and enjoy the scene :) or you could see the demo video for my presentation (I added the dark/night light mode after that and re-record the video)
    * Video demo with very light background audios: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14aAyibr2q_53XpqHCVdHGUECZDJz8R-U/view?usp=sharing
  * You could also find the demo script in the link below:

* Source Code
* Blender Source File
  * I did not include any self-built OBJ files in this zip, if you have any doubts, feel free to contact me! Or you could download them via the link below:

## Environment and Devices

1. Hardware (CPU): Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10510U CPU @ 1.80GHz
2. Hardware (GPU): NVIDIA GeForce MX250
3. Software for code programming: Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Community Version
4. Software for 3D model building: Blender 2.93
5. Programming Language: C++
6. OpenGL Library: GLFW (Because of the library conflict, I chose to use GLFW instead of the GLUT taught by lab, it is a great opportunity to extend what I have learned in the classroom to conduct self exploration.)

## Run

To run the 3D scene, open the `CG_CW_20124917_Gaole_Dai.sln` file in Visual Studio.

Choose **x64** then run the `main.cpp` in `Code` file.
